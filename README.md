# I Want to Believe
My good friend Dana got a new job, reporting on UFO sightings! She has asked me to put together a webpage with Javascript that can sort/filter through user inputed criteria to look at various UFO sightings across the country! Our Webpage includes a dynamic table that users can input their own search criteria for UFO sightings. 
## UFO Sightings 101
Upon visiting our webpage you are greeted by message from W. Avy, a UFO-enthusiast and amateur ufologist as well as Local CEO and vocal anti-alien activist V. Isualize.
Scroll down the page and you will see the UFO search feature.
In the first box you can input a date, which will bring up every sighting of UFOs on that date.

You can also search by locations like a city. Enter a city name and see how many times UFO's have visited that city.

You can expand that search to even larger area by searching by the state

It can be expanded even further by searching by country!

I also added a filter for shape of the UFO, so we can know what kind of visitors they are!

Finally, you can get super specific and search with multiple filters!
