# I Want to Believe
My good friend Dana got a new job, reporting on UFO sightings! She has asked me to put together a webpage with Javascript that can sort/filter through user inputed criteria to look at various UFO sightings across the country! Our Webpage includes a dynamic table that users can input their own search criteria for UFO sightings. 
## UFO Sightings 101
Upon visiting our webpage you are greeted by message from W. Avy, a UFO-enthusiast and amateur ufologist as well as Local CEO and vocal anti-alien activist V. Isualize.
Scroll down the page and you will see the UFO search feature.
In the first box you can input a date

When you enter a date it will show every sighting on that date.
Next you can enter a city and see how many times UFO's have visited.

You can expand that search to even larger area by searching by the state

It can be expanded even further by searching by country!

And last but not least, you can sort by shape of the UFO to see what kinds of UFOs are visting!
